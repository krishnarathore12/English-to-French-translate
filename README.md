# English-to-French-translate
Here we fine-tuned the Google T5 model for English to French translation using the OPUS Books dataset and subsequently hosting the resulting model on Hugging Face.

## About Model
Google-T5 uses a unified text-to-text framework that treats every NLP task as a text-to-text problem. This means that the model can use the same input, loss function, and hyperparameters for a variety of tasks, such as translation, question answering, and classification.

## Dataset
The OPUS Books dataset is a collection of parallel text specifically designed for training and evaluating machine translation models on book content. It's part of the larger OPUS project, which curates datasets for various Natural Language Processing tasks.
